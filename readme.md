This is a gambling simulation. You know, the casino is always has an edge over the gambler.
That's why the casino keep making money and the gambler keep loosing money.

After long run, let's say 1.000.000 bets, and here is what I got :

`++++++++++++++++++++++`

`Final Result`

`rohman Balance              : -1130390.0`

`casino Balance              : 1150390.0`

`rohman Win Probability      : 49.9305%`

`casino Win Probability      : 50.0695%`

`++++++++++++++++++++++`

I tested over and over again. However, the result is still the same. My win probability was always close to 50%. Then, because of the casino has an edge over me, I lose my money.
