This is a gambling simulation. You know, casino always has an edge over gambler.
That's why casino keep making money and gambler keep loosing money.

After long run, I tried to simulate 1.000.000 bets, and here is what I got :

`++++++++++++++++++++++`

`Final Result`

`rohman Balance              : -1130390.0`

`casino Balance              : 1150390.0`

`rohman Win Probability      : 49.9305%`

`casino Win Probability      : 50.0695%`

`++++++++++++++++++++++`

I tried several times. However, the result is still the same. My win probability always close to 50%. Then, because of casino has an edge over me, I lose my money.
